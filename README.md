# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Rhythmic secretion of prolactin in rats: action of oxytocin coordinated by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide of suprachiasmatic nucleus origin.**   
Egli M, Bertram R, Sellix MT, Freeman ME. _Endocrinology_ 2004
Jul;145(7):3386-94 [15033917](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15033917) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Prolactin (PRL) is secreted from lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland
of rats in a unique pattern in response to uterine cervical stimulation (CS)
during mating. Surges of PRL secretion occur in response to relief from
hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition and stimulation by hypothalamic releasing
neurohormones. In this study, we characterized the role of oxytocin (OT) in
this system and the involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)
from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in controlling OT and PRL secretion of
CS rats. The effect of OT on PRL secretion was demonstrated in cultured
lactotrophs showing simultaneous enhanced secretion rate and increased
intracellular Ca(2+). Neurosecretory OT cells of the hypothalamic
paraventricular nucleus that express VIP receptors were identified by using
immunocytochemical techniques in combination with the retrogradely transported
neuronal tracer Fluoro-Gold (iv injected). OT measurements of serial blood
samples obtained from ovariectomized (OVX) CS rats displayed a prominent
increase at the time of the afternoon PRL peak. The injection of VIP antisense
oligonucleotides into the SCN abolished the afternoon increase of OT and PRL
in CS-OVX animals. These findings suggest that VIP from the SCN contributes to
the regulation of OT and PRL secretion in CS rats. We propose that in CS rats
the regulatory mechanism(s) for PRL secretion comprise coordinated action of
neuroendocrine dopaminergic and OT cells, both governed by the daily rhythm of
VIP-ergic output from the SCN. This hypothesis is illustrated with a
mathematical model.
